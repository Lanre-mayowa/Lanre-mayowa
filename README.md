### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm mayowa

I have always loved Data analytics, as I started out my career as an ERP Database Analyst, learning Data migration from an ERP system to Microsoft Access and my first foray into SQL and VBA programming. Then a brief stint as a Business Intelligence analyst in 2018,  where I discovered Pivot Tables and Power Query in Microsoft Excel, and also the MSBI Stack (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS) and Power BI, which eventually influenced my decision to become a Business Intelligence Developer.
